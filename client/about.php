	<h4 class="text-secondary">Introduction</h4>
	<p>Established in 2019, the Pet Owner Association remains the only trade-only Association within Australia, dedicated to the protection of the pet industry, and promoting responsible pet ownership.</p>
	<p>The pet industry is very heavily regulated by Government Agencies at federal, state and local levels. There are also many animal welfare and animal rights groups within the community that want to influence or prevent us doing legitimate business. It is becoming more important that the operators within the Australian Pet Industry take greater control of their own destiny. As such, the Pet Industry Association regularly makes formal submissions on pet industry issues at the request of Government agencies and industry regulators</p>

	<h4 class="text-secondary">Code of Practice</h4>
	<p>Pet Industry Association members have a National Code of Practice that was produced by members for the sole purpose of “self regulation” at the highest workable level. This Code has been very well accepted by Government and its standards exceed our regulators’ requirements. PIAA also has sector specific Standards & Guidelines.</p>
	
	<h4 class="text-secondary">Our Purpose</h4>
	<p class="text-center">"<i>To support our members while being the recognised and respected voice of the pet industry.</i>"</p>
	<p>The main purpose of Pet owner Association membership is the ability of an individual business operator to network with their peers and also be able to make a comment through a “Peak Industry Body” to almost any regulator of the industry – and be heard!</p>
